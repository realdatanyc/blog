## My First Blog Post
Once upon a time, I decided my dream would be to move to New York City.  I had gotten involved in theater after college and I was interested in knowing what living in New York City would be like. I made it in 1995, and I'm hre 27 years later.
I don't take it for granted - especialy now. Time has flown quickly, and many of the friends I made while living here have relocated to other parts of the country.  I press on, inspired by my love of theater, film, and especially the story. 

I work as "broker", officially a "licensed real estate salesperson" -- according to my NYS license.  My role is an advisor and agent. Thank you for visiting my blog and joining me! -- RL
