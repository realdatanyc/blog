## Create your own blog on Github
The main advantage for creating your own blog on Github is that it doesn't cost you a monthly fee.  Here's where I learned how: [Building a Free Blog with GitHub Pages in Minutes](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)

Another advantage is that it doesn't contain ads.  Also, you can easily update the pages, edit, and add more things.

I found this blog about movie trailers while searching for the saying "There are 8 million stories in the naked city":  [8 million stories - Trailers from Hell](https://trailersfromhell.com/there-are-8-million-stories/)

Now, it's time to start writing! -- RL
